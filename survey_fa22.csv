I went to First Friday this quarter for the first time (I am in my fourth year) with a friend and we found it to be very fun. It was a scavenger type of event which added to the excitement, because it meant that we had to visit various tables to obtain stamps. However, the good thing about the scavenger hunt is that we were able to learn about different resources on campus! :)","I am always excited about the events that involve music and fun. An example would be Battle of the Bands, sport showings at Dirty Birds, You at the Loft, Triton Fest, Bear Garden, and Sun God. What these events have in common is the amount of people who show up. These people share similar interests, tis why they show up, and it becomes fun interacting with such attendees.","As a fourth year, I worry that, even though there are many events to attend to, some may get cancelled which is a bummer. I would like to attend many events as I can going into my last year. ","2022 is coming to an end (time flies by fast) and 2023 is on the way. With 6 months left on campus, I feel anxious not knowing my plans for post-graduation and also what to expect in the upcoming year. Thus, I never know what to expect which worries me. :,)","In the past years, I was not interested in the student government. Though, recently I did attend an event to support a friend who was running for a position which made me realize how important the student government is and who is on the board. Thus, I would like to learn more about the student government on campus.","Associated Students is an important aspect for the student population on campus. I am glad I got to learn more about AS throughout the years, Additionally, this survey got me thinking about AS on a deeper level, so I thought that filling out this survey was helpful and I hope to fill out more in the future! :D"
